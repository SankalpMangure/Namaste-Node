1. asynchronous IO === non-blocking IO => it handle multiple request using multiple thread => open source
    using single thread it can do so many things parellel 

* node js uses V8 engine of brower or it node js works on V8 engine
   Node.js is work on event-driven architecture.

2. node REPL => read (read the code), evalaute (evalaute the code), print (priunt output), loop (do it again)

3. node js is javascript runtime environment 

4. module => u can say module is collection of code which is private to itself

5. import/export =>  coz modules are default protected => so that we need to export and import(require) somewhere
    type 1 : comman js module  => which is default in node so that we use require => module.export then "require('')" => non strict mode 
    type 2 : ES modules  => u need to give type module in package.json => export  then "import from" => strict mode

6. IIFE =>  immediately invoked function expression => (function(){})() => all modules are IIFE 
    after require and module.exports => it does (function(require, module.exports={}){})() => like code in module nodeJS add into IIFE and it automatically executes

7. asynchrnous => node js can perform asynchrnous task but javascript is synchronous <= synchronous
    
8. libuv => using libuv asynchrnous task are made simple => u can say coz of libuv nodeJS is asynchrnous 
         => it contains thredpools, event loops, queues
         => responsible to make call then get data then take that callback function and give it back to callstack 

9. setTimeOut has trust issues that if u want to execute it after 0 sec then also only if call stack of main thred is empty then then it execute 

10. Event loop has major 4 phases
    1. timer => setTimeout,setInterval
    2. pool => I/O callback (file reading,api call) => if call stack and callbck queues empty then event loop wait here
    3. check => setImmediate wale callback run hotat
    4. close => closing connection

    *5 process.nextTick => 1st very hightest priority
    *6 promise => 2nd very hightest priority

    1 TICK =><= 1 circle complete of all phases

11. libuv contains=>
    1. event loop
    2. callback queues
    3. thread pool

12. thread pool =>
    default size is 4 threads => UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE == 4
    all actions from pool(2nd phase) done into thread pool

    if u give synchronous code then it single threaded
    if u give asynchrnous code then using libUv it will be multi threaded

    u can change thread pool size => process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=2;

13. IMP RULES
    1. never block the main thread
    2. dont use sync methods (readSync,writeSync)

14. When client send request to server it creates socket then return data and close socket connection 
    for socket connection it use TCP/IP protocol
    protocol => set of rule to communicate
    stream & buffer => stream === sending data && buffer === this data is in chunk not all at a time
15. DNS server => domain name 
16. Web-Socket=> its jsut like socket but, in socket for after single request it close socket connaction but in 
    web socket it holds the conncrion and do multiple requests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. express.js => is node js fremework which is build on top on nodeJs which is use to create web server
18. MangoDb => stores data in json/documents format, flexible, more compatible with node js 
    collection => documents => fields
    no need of normalization, no need to join

19. JWT token divided into 3 parts =>
    1. red => header
    2. pink => payload
    3. blue => signature
20. create .env file => create constant variable into it
    - require('dotenv).config()

21. node-cron 
    - cron.schedule("* * * * *", () =>{

    })
    - add only require("filename")
