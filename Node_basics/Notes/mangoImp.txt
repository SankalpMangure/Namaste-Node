1. type : mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId => this used in mongoose for storing _id as a Foreign Key into another schema

2. enum : this will be array, the values present in array only should be acceptable, other values will be ignored

    status:{
      type: String,
      enum:{
        values:["accepted","rejected","pending","ignored"],
        message:"${VALUE} is incorrect" // this msg appear when value is wrong
      }
    }

    this validate at mongoose schema end so, you dont need any validation in node/react
    you can write custom validation using "Validate" function

3. write OR condition in node with mongoose
    await connestionRequest.findOne({
      $or:[
        {formUserId:formUserId,toUserId:toUserId},
        {formUserId:toUserId,toUserId:formUserId},
      ]
    })

4. pre => pre is used for if you want to do something and before that this called and then goes to somewhere
   
   Schema.pre("save",function(){

   })

   this is like this pre called before mongoose save method
   you can called this as middleware

5. index in mangoDB => suppose you have billions of records and you want to do search operation, then query will take so much
   time for searching, to overcome this problem you can use indexing,
   indexing is like giving sr. no to field so it will automatice overcome query time

   Schema.index({emailId:1}) //1=>asc, -1=> desc
   Schema.index({formUserId:1, toUserId||:1}) => compound indexing

6. mangooseSchema methods => which is called as handler/helper => eg. like addling jwt sign which is do once here
    this are only simple functions not a arrow function
    use this keyword here which referes to current object
    this not works with arrow function FYI

7. there are 2 imp functions in mangoDB 
    skip() => like offset in Sql
    limit() => like limit in Sql

8. $nin => not in
   $eq => equal to
   both used with $and condition
